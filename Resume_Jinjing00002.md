Sep 2023 - Feb 2024

:::

- Developed a distributed real-time monitoring and analysis system for waste collection sites using **Spring Boot**, **MongoDB** and **React**/**Redux**, optimizing the recycling process to improve efficiency and support environmental goals.
- Cached hotspot data with **Redis**, reducing query time from 127ms to 23ms. Implemented a multi-level caching strategy (including local and distributed caching), further decreasing data access latency to around 10ms.
- Managed authentication and authorization using **react-router**, controlling permissions at the button level and displaying different menus and buttons based on user roles.
- Researched and implemented **react-virtualized** to encapsulate virtual scrolling, rendering only the elements currently visible in the viewport, thereby solving performance issues caused by rendering large datasets (2000+ items) all at once.
- Enabled real-time notifications with **RabbitMQ**, configuring a 3-retry mechanism and message persistence to ensure critical data is successfully delivered to users within 5 seconds.
